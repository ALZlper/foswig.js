# Foswig.js

A Javascript library which allows you to easily create [Markov chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) based on arbitrary dictionaries in order to create readable pseudo random words (Yes the name was generated by the library)

## Usage

```Javascript
// the more words in the dictionary, the more varied and
// interesting the output will be
var dictionary = ["hello","foswig"];

// Create the markov chain and specify the Order of the markov chain.
// The order (an integer > 0) indicates how many previous letters are 
// taken into account when selecting the next. A smaller order will
// result in more randomized less recognizeable output. Conversely a
// higher order will result in words which resemble more closely those
// in the original dictionary.
var chain = new foswig.MarkovChain(3);

//load the words into the markov chain
for (var i=0;i<dictionary.length;++i) {
  chain.addWordToChain(dictionary[i]);
}

// generate a random word with a maximum of 10 letters
var randomWord = chain.generateWord(10);
```
